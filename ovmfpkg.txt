cd <udk2017_path>/OvmfPkg (e.g. for my setup: "<private>/tools/edk2-env2/OvmfPkg/")

In build.sh look for line:
  build -p $PLATFORMFILE $BUILD_OPTIONS -b $BUILDTARGET -t $TARGET_TOOLS -n $THREADNUMBER
and add below:
  cp -f --verbose $FV_DIR/OVMF_CODE.fd $WORKSPACE/../qemu/
  cp -f --verbose $FV_DIR/OVMF_VARS.fd $WORKSPACE/../qemu/

In OvmfPkgIa32X64.dsc look for line:
  DEFINE_SMM_REQUIRE = FALSE
and modify to:
  DEFINE_SMM_REQUIRE = TRUE

In <udk2017_path>/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.inf look for line:
  [Sources.Ia32]
and remove all child entries (no 32 bits support is needed anymore)

In <udk2017_path>/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.inf look for line:
  [Sources.X64]
and remove all assembly file entries ending in .S and .asm keeping only those ending in .nasm

In Terminal make sure working directory is <udk2017_path>/OvmfPkg and enter:
./build.sh


Instructions below "ASM_PFX(gcSmmInitTemplate):" in "<udk2017_path>/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/X64/SmmInit.nasm"
are (some of?) the first instructions that are executed when entering SMM first time.
